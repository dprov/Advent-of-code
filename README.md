Solutions to problems of Advent of code

## 2022 - https://adventofcode.com/2022
### What I want to do
1. Refac/cleanup code so it can showcase code quality
2. Finish problems (at least those I'm interested in)
3. Make more code reusable for other AOC years

### IDEAS: 
- Restructure into 1 folder per day
    - Includes input.py, example.py, solution.py, test.py to simplify multi-year
