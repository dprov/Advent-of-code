# Advent-of-code-2022
# Solutions to problems on https://adventofcode.com/2022
# What I want to do
- Refac/cleanup code so it can showcase code quality
- Finish problems (at least those I'm interested in)
- Make more code reusable for other AOC years

# IDEAS: 
- Restructure into 1 folder per day
- - Includes input.py, example.py, solution.py, test.py
